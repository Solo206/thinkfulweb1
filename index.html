		<h1>Is HTML considered a programming language?</h1>
		<p>No, HTML is a markup language.  The "M" stands for <b>"Markup"</b>. Generally a programming language allows you to describe some sort of process of doing something, whereas HTMl is a way of adding context and structure to text.</p>
		<p>One of the commenters in Stack Overflow explained that HTML5+CSS3 could be considered Turing complete.  <dfn>Turing complete</dfn> is according to wikipedia: a system of data-manipulation rules that can be used to simulate any single-taped Turing machine.  In other words its a system that will find an answer or solve computational problems.</p>
		<p>The prevailing thought however still remains that HTML by itself is not a programming language.  A blog from Syracuse University succintly  posits that HTML "is not an example of an executable script".  It points out that HTML is used for structural purposes on a web page, not functional ones".  Programming languages must have functional purposes, such as evaluative, computational or logical nature.</p>

		<h1>What is a tag?</h1>
		<p>According to w3chools.com, HTML tags can be identified with several significant features: surround keywords with angle brackets, come in pairs, consist of start/end tag or opening-closing pairs, and end tag is written with a slash. Wikipedia points out that tags are used to interpret content of pages.  HTML describes structure of website semantically.  Tags help parse content into an organized form to be digested by browser.  Tags also can give meaning to specific portions of web page content and provide browsers/search engine extra information regarding how the content should be interpreted.</p>

		<h1>How can you tell the difference between an open and closing tag?</h1>
		<p>As stated before an open tag is a tag without a slash and a closing tag is one with a slash. It is signifies this is a parseable element from the rest of the html document.  An example of an open tag is <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and its closing tag is <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>.  Everything inside that tag is content associated with that tag element.  </p>

		<h1>Does the <code>&lt;!doctype&gt;</code> tag come before or after <code>&lt;html&gt;?</code></h1>
		<p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> comes before html tags.  It informs the browser what type of document its reading.  This abbreviated document typing is a new feature of HTML5.  Previous HTML versions had required whether the document was strict, transitional, frameset.  In HTML5, the document type declaration only requires <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> to coded at the beginning of document.</p>

		<h1>Does information between <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> appear on rendered page?	</h1>
		<p>No, information between head tags do not appear on the rendered page.  According to w3school <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element contains all head elements which include title for document, scripts, styles, meta information.  Typically <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> is where meta information is located regarding how the document should be read, linked, and styled.

		<h1>What does the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> do?</h1>
		<p>The title tag typically represents text that will appear on the tab of your document page.  It also will be the title of your bookmark for that particular page.  According to w3schools, it defines the title of the browser toolbar, provides a title for the page when added to favorites and displays a title for the page in search-engine results</p>

		<h1>What goes inside the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags of a page?</h1>
		<p>The main content of your document resides in the body of the page including articles, images, headers, footers, etc.  W3schools defines <code>&lt;body&gt; tag as the documents body that contains the contents of HTML document such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc.</code></p>

		<h1>What's a div?</h1>
		<p><code>&lt;div&gt; is a tag without semantic meaning but helps parse out content throughout the document.  W3schools defines div tags as a division or section in an HTML document. It is a primary block-elemtn group that is used to format a document in conjunciton with CSS.  From sitepoint.com/web foundations, div is a generic block-element that doesn't convey semantic meaning.</code></p>

		<h1>What's the difference between a block element(for instance, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>) and an inline element (for instance <code>&lt;span&gt;</code></div></h1>
		<p>Block element is element that takes up the entire width of the screen and does not allow for other elements to reside next to it.  Inline elements allow other elements to be adjacent to it on a horizontal line.  <b>HTML Dogs</b> website states that a <b>span</b> is an inline element that resides in a paragraph, whereas <b>div</b>  is a block-line which takes up the entire line with line breaks before and after it.  Inline elements allow text and other elements to wrap around it.  It can be useful for specifying the alignment of that element according to surrounding elements.</p>  
		<p>Common examples of block elements include (from <cite>webdesignfromscratch.com</cite>:
		<dl>
			<dt>div</dt>
				<dd>Your general-purpose box</dd>
			<dt>h1-h6</dt>
				<dd>All headings</dd>
			<dt>p</dt>
				<dd>paragraph</dd>
			<dt>ul,ol,dl</dt>
				<dd>Lists(unordered,ordered and definition</dd>
			<dt>li,dt,dd</dt>
				<dd>Lists(unordered, ordered and definition</dd>
			<dt>table</dt>
				<dd>Tables</dd>
			<dt>blockquote</dt>
				<dd>Like an indented paragraph, meant for quoting passages of text</dd>
			<dt>pre</dt>
				<dd>Indicates a block of preformatted code</dd>
			<dt>form</dt>
				<dd>An input form</dd>

		</dl>
		Common examples of inline elements  include (from <cite>webdesignfromscratch.com</cite>):
		<dl>
			<dt>span</dt>
				<dd>Your all purpose inline element</dd>
			<dt>a</dt>
				<dd>Anchor used for links and also to mark specific targets on a page for direct linking</dd>
			<dt>strong</dt>
				<dd>Used to make your content strong displayed as bold browsers, but also carries additional meaning of importance emphasis</dd>
			<dt>em</dt>
				<dd>Displayed as italic text, but used for stress emphasis terms</dd>
			<dt>bold</dt>
				<dd>Used for keywords, product names, or typographic presentation</dd>
			<dt>i</dt>
				<dd>Used for offset prose, technical term, thought, ship name, alternate voice or mood</dd>
			<dt>img</dt>
				<dd>Image, such as photos, pics, graphs, etc. </dd>
			<dt>br</dt>
				<dd>Line-break is an odd case as its an inline element that forces a new line.  How as the text carries on the next line, its not a block level element</dd>
			<dt>input</dt>
				<dd>Form input fields like text forms</dd>
			<dt>abbr</dt>
				<dd>Indicates an abbrevation</dd>
			<dt>acronym</dt>
				<dd>Working much like the abbreviation, but used for this like TLA</dd>
