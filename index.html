		<h1>Is HTML considered a programming language?</h1>
		<p>No, HTML is a markup language.  The "M" stands for "Markup". Generally a programming language allows you to describe some sort of process of doing something, whereas HTMl is a way of adding context and structure to text.</p>
		<p>One of the commenters in Stack Overflow explained that HTML5+CSS3 could be considered Turing complete.  Turing complete is according to wikipedia: a system of data-manipulation rules that can be used to simulate any single-taped Turing machine.  In other words its a system that will find an answer or solve computational problems.</p>
		<p>The prevailing thought however still remains that HTML by itself is not a programming language.  A blog from Syracuse University succintly  posits that HTML "is not an example of an executable script".  It points out that HTML is used for structural purposes on a web page, not functional ones".  Programming languages must have functional purposes, such as evaluative, computational or logical nature.</p>

		<h1>What is a tag?</h1>
		<p>According to w3chools.com, HTML tags can be identified with several significant features: surround keywords with angle brackets, come in pairs, consist of start/end tag or opening-closing pairs, and end tag is written with a slash. Wikipedia points out that tags are used to interpret content of pages.  HTML describes structure of website semantically.  Tags help parse content into an organized form to be digested by browser.  Tags also can give meaning to specific portions of web page content and provide browsers/search engine extra information regarding how the content should be interpreted.</p>

		<h1>How can you tell the difference between an open and closing tag?</h1>
		<p>As stated before an open tag is a tag without a slash and a closing tag is one with a slash. It is signifies this is a parseable element from the rest of the html document.  An example of an open tag is <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and its closing tag is <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>.  Everything inside that tag is content associated with that tag element.  </p>
