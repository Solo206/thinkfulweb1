		<h1>Is HTML considered a programming language?</h1>
		<p>No, HTML is a markup language.  The "M" stands for "Markup". Generally a programming language allows you to describe some sort of process of doing something, whereas HTMl is a way of adding context and structure to text.</p>
		<p>One of the commenters in Stack Overflow explained that HTML5+CSS3 could be considered Turing complete.  Turing complete is according to wikipedia: a system of data-manipulation rules that can be used to simulate any single-taped Turing machine.  In other words its a system that will find an answer or solve computational problems.</p>
		<p>The prevailing thought however still remains that HTML by itself is not a programming language.  A blog from Syracuse University succintly  posits that HTML "is not an example of an executable script".  It points out that HTML is used for structural purposes on a web page, not functional ones".  Programming languages must have functional purposes, such as evaluative, computational or logical nature.</p>
